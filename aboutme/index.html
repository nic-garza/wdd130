    <p>Hi y'all! The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is being in the state of Idaho! I'm proud to live in such a beautiful place with so many hardworking, God-fearing, and down to earth people. I love to camp, hunt, fish, and ride bulls. 
         I am currently studying Computer Information Technology. I hope to use my degree to make a real positive impact on peoples lives. 
         I think with skills and knowledge in web design, the opprotunites for growth in today's climate are endless. </p>
