    <p>Hi y'all! The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is being in the state of Idaho! I love to camp, hunt, fish, and ride bulls. 
         I am currently studying Business Management and Marketing. I hope to use my degree to make a positive impact on peoples lives. 
         I think with skills and knowledge in web design, your opprotunities are endless. </p>
