                    <h1>Riding Equipment</h1>
                    <h4>Gloves</h4>
                    <p>Bull riding gloves are used to protect the riders hand. It is usually made out of deer or cow hyde.</p>
                    <h4>Ropes</h4>
                    <p>The Bull rope is the riders single most important piece of equipment. It is quite literally what is connecting the rider to the bull. Bull ropes are hand braided 
                        with traditional rope materials or synthetic rope materials. There are two different types of Bull ropes- American Styles and Brazillian Styles. The difference
                        is the way the rope pulls tight. </p>
                    <h4>Rosin</h4>
                    <p>Rosin is a sticky substance, similar to pinetar, that bull riders put on their bull rope to make it sticky. When it is rubbed into the rope with friction, it heats 
                        up and melts, causing it to become even more sticky almost like a glue. 
                    </p>

                    <h1>Protective Equipment</h1>
                    <h4>Helmet</h4>
                    <p>Traditionally, Bull Riders did not where a helmet and rather just wore their own cowboy hat. Although this was the norm, it was extremley dangerous because while on the 
                        back of a 2,000 pound bucking bull there was a lot that one could hit their head on.  As time and technlogy advanced, helmets became more and more common to the point where 
                        it is now more rare to see a bullrider ride without a helmet. </p>
                    <h4>Vest</h4>
                    <p>Much like the Bull Riding helmet, wearing a vest was never included in Bull riding till around 1990. It was sparked by the tragic death of one of the best Bull Riders of all time,
                        the great Lane Frost. Lane was gored by a Bull in Cheyenne, Wyoming, breaking his ribs and causing damage to his heart which took his life. After that protective vest could be seen
                        every rodeo from the pro's all the way down to junior rodeo.</p>
                    <h4>Chaps</h4>
                    <p>Chaps are the most traditional part of the Bull Riders equipment. Real cowboys would wear chaps to protect their legs from both the cattle they were working and also from the harsh 
                        elements out on the range. Now Bull Riders wear them mostly as a way to tip their hat to their western heritage. Althogh they don't to much to protect the riders legs, they do give
                        a small amout of extra grip while trying to stay on the bull.
