        During the summertime in the more rural parts of the United States the sport of Rodeo and Bull Riding attract thousands of people every year and every time they come they always have a million questions about this fascinating sport because it is so far from the norm of almost all people. 
        It interest them so much because it is truly and dying sport and Bull riders are the last of a dying breed. People will come to my site to get information about bull riding versus others because I am a Bull Rider myself who has been on more than 30 head in the last year and I also have a deep passion for the sport.
        I want to introduce anyone who comes to the site to the western world and heritage and why there is so much pride surrounding it. I also want to link the history of cowboys and Bull riding and then go into the history of Bull riding and explain how it came to be a sport. 
        On the home page is where you would overall get familiar with the sport of Bull riding. On the home page I will explain the judging and how one “wins” a Bull riding competition. It will also explain the rules and how bull ridings are judged.
        I want to also cover a large section about how in Bull riding and Rodeo as a whole, the animals are treated as athletes as well as the riders. The animals are taken care of well and I want to break the common misconception that the animals in Bull riding are abused. I want to highlight the high moral standards of the cowboy and how tough cowboys are.
        I want to explain that Rodeo is a part of western culture.

      <h3>Rodeos</h3>
      <p>
        In this section I want to explain about the actual events of Bull riding. Im thinking I will highlight the difference between the PRCA and the PBR. Then I will explain how the circuit system in the PRCA works and how one advances which will then take us into the NFR and then explain all about that.
        Then I will explain about the PBR and how one advances in that world. I will explain the different tours within the PBR. After I make that distinction clear I would like to go into the biggest events of both the PBR and the PRCA and tell about where they are and why they are significant.
