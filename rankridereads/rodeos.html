                <h3>Pro Rodeo Cowboy Association (PRCA)</h3>
                <p>There are two major places professional Bull Riders can go to make a living. The first is the Pro Rodeo Cowboy Association or the PRCA.
                    The PRCA is the largest American rodeo organization in the world. The history of the PRCA reflects the spirit of the struggle that was 
                    required to tame the untamed of a rodeo rider. It traces itself all the way back to 1936 when a group of cowboys went on strike. Long story
                    short, they established an institution of sorts. It existed all the way up to 1945 after which it was converted into the PRCA. There are 7 
                    rodeo sports in the PRCA recognizes and holds various competitions for, tie-down roping, bull riding, saddle bronc riding, bareback riding,
                    barrel racing, steer wrestling and team roping. These activities are what form the essence of what is called rodeo and which millions of people 
                    flock to aattempt to recapture some memories of the good ol' days.

                <h3>Professional Bull Riders (PBR)</h3>
                <p>The PBR was founded in 1992 by a group of 20 visionary bull riders who broke away from the traditional rodeo scene, seeking mainstream attention,
                    new riches and a livelihood for future generations of cowboys for the most popular disipline in rodeo, bull riding. The founders believed that
                    bull riding deserved to be in the limelight and could succeed as a standalone sport. Each rider invested a hard-earned $1,000, some borrowing from
                    family and friends, to start the PBR. Fastforward to today, more than 500 bull riders from around the world including the United States, Australia,
                    Canada and Mexico hold PBR memberships. They compete in more than 200 bull riding events each year on the nationally-televised Unleash The Beast, 
                    Pendleton Whisky Velocity Tour and Touring Pro Devision, in addition to those held by international divisions in Australia, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.
                    For every rider, the ultimate goal is to qualify for the PBR World Finals, the richest bull riding event on the planet, with the season champion receiving
                    the golden World Championship buckle and $1 million bonus.
